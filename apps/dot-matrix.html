			<p>Beginning as a game that we would play occasionally in 6th grade math, Dot Matrix is a game that takes a spin on a classic game by introducing a dice roll. The game begins with a grid of nine by seventeen boxes. The goal of this game is to get either a high score or a low score. To do this, you must click to remove a rectangle of dots whose dimensions match the parameters below the grid.</p>
