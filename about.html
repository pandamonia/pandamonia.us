			<h2>The Backstory</h2>
			<p>Alex and Zach met in quite an unconventional manner: they met on GitHub when Zach commented on <a href="http://github.com/magicalpanda/MagicalRecord/pull/82" target="_blank">one</a> of Alex&rsquo;s pull requests. (I know, right? How nerdy is that!) However, Alex noticed that Zach was already working on a version of this project, and he asked if he could help with it. They talked a lot because they collaborated often, and after a while, Alex and Zach became good friends. Ultimately, Alex asked Zach if he would join Pandamonia.</p>

			<h2>Why the name?</h2>
			<p>Alex loves pandas. A lot. In fact, he has liked pandas ever since he and his sister encountered an <a href="http://d.pnd.mn/wAsO" data-reveal-id="pandaModal">animated GIF</a> of a dancing panda online oh so many years ago. People say that his love for pandas can only be described with one word: <em>pandamonium</em>. The name Pandamonia comes from the non-existent plural form of this word which means &ldquo;furor caused by or involving pandas&rdquo; (<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pandamonium" target="_black">Wiktionary</a>).</p>
