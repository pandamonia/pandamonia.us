			<h4 class="subheader">Introduction</h4>
			<p>Many programming languages (e.g. Ruby, Python, Lisp) conceptualize a reusable self-contained "unit of work" to simplify context and scope. In these languages, they are called "closures" or "lambdas." Since OS X 10.6 and iOS 4.0, Objective-C (as well as C and C++) developers have their own: blocks.</p>
			<p>Blocks in Objective-C are downright magical, and if you aren't using them yet, you're missing out. They make coding easier and quicker: since they're a plain-C compiler feature, they're as fast as a function call. Blocks capture all forms of scope in a declarative and expressive way. No more <code>-[MyClass _reallyDoThing:]</code>. No more callback hell.</p>
			<p>The one issue with blocks to someone obnoxiously obsessive, like us, is that they aren't <strong>absolutely everywhere</strong>. iOS 4.0 introduced a number of block mechanisms, but they're still not all the way there. BlocksKit hopes to help with that.</p>
			<p>Ideally, a block mechanism should be available everywhere where you would find:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>a callback-based delegate mechanism (<code>UIAlertView</code>)</li>
				<li>a target/selector pattern (<code>UIControl</code>, <code>UIGestureRecognizer</code>)</li>
				<li>a repeatable, context-less utility (<code>NSArray</code> looping, transformation)</li>
				<li>an arbitrary selector call (<code>-[NSObject performSelector:withDelay:]</code>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>BlocksKit supports all these and many more patterns.</p>

				<dt>Core</dt>
				<dd>Extend Foundation with simple extensions for:
					<ul>
						<li>Enumerating, filtering, and mapping the core data types</li>
						<li>Key-value observing using blocks</li>
						<li>Block-backed invocations</li>
						<li>Delayed block execution</li>
						<li>Block-backed timers</li>
					</ul>

				<dt>Dynamic Delegate</dt>
				<dd>Embrace the power of the battle-hardened <a href="http://www.sourceware.org/libffi/">libffi</a> to automatically replace delegates on a class. Ever wanted <code>UIAlertView.didDismissBlock</code>? You got it.</dd>
				<dt>UIKit</dt>
				<dd>Replace common delegates, respond to control actions, or initialize bar button items. No more selectors, no more boilerplate.</dd>
				<dt>Message UI</dt>
				<dd>Present mail and text message popups, no delegate needed.</dd>
